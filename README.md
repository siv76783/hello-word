Matthew 5.44 " Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you that you may be the childern of your Father in Heaven. He causes his Sun to raise over evil and good, and sends rain on the righteouts and unrighteous. If you Love thos that Love you, what reward will you get? Are even tax collectors doing that?"
